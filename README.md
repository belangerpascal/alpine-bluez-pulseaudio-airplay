## [Alpine-PulseAudio][234]
#### Container for Alpine Linux + PulseAudio + Bluez + Airplay
---

This [image][233] containerizes the [PulseAudio][135] Network
Sound server to setup a central sound service inside a local
network, also runs the [Bluez][136] bluetooth daemon to work with
bluetooth speakers or sources. Includes [Pulsemixer][137] to
manage pulseaudio from CLI.

Based on [Alpine Linux][131] from my [alpine-s6][132] image with
the [s6][133] init system [overlayed][134] in it.

The image is tagged respectively for the following architectures,
* **armhf**
* **armv7l**
* **aarch64**
* **x86_64** (retagged as the `latest` )

**non-x86_64** builds have embedded binfmt_misc support and contain the
[qemu-user-static][105] binary that allows for running it also inside
an x86_64 environment that has it.

---
#### Get the Image
---

Pull the image for your architecture it's already available from
Docker Hub.

```
# make pull
docker pull woahbase/alpine-pulseaudio:x86_64
```

---
#### Configuration Defaults
---

* PulseAudio config files read from `/etc/pulse`. If you have
  custom cards other than your default sound output jack, most
  likely you will need to edit or remount this with your own. For
  example, you can keep the files inside `config/pulse` and mount
  it as `/etc/pulse` on start.

* Does not run own systemd or dbus daemon so cards might not get
  detected automatically, default configuration loads only the
  defauls Alsa Sink, so will need to modify configurations to
  detect the new hardware.

* Default configuration listens to ports `4713`. Will need to have
  this port accessible from add devices to get sound. (Check your
  firewall).

* Bluetooth configurations read from `/etc/bluetooth`.

* To persist paired bluetooth configurations, preserve the
  contents of `/var/lib/bluetooth` by mounting it someplace like
  `config/devices`.

* DBUS can cause permission issues if the host is not configured to
  allow Bluez or PulseAudio. Host configuration defaults for these
  are provided inside `/config/dbus`.

* Any drivers for audio (and/or bluetooth as in Rasperry Pis) will
  need to be installed in the host machine.

* Don't for get to set the environment variable `PULSE_SERVER` as
  your server host in the client machines so that they forward
  their sound to the server.  Check out [this][138] link for more
  information.

* To run only the pulseaudio server without starting bluetooth,
  set the environment variable `DISABLEBLUETOOTH` to the string
  `true`.

---
#### Run
---

If you want to run images for other architectures, you will need
to have binfmt support configured for your machine. [**multiarch**][104],
has made it easy for us containing that into a docker container.

```
# make regbinfmt
docker run --rm --privileged multiarch/qemu-user-static:register --reset
```

Without the above, you can still run the image that is made for your
architecture, e.g for an x86_64 machine..

This image runs PulseAudio under the user `root`, but also has
a user `pulse` configured to drop privileges to the passed
`PUID`/`PGID` which is ideal if its used to run in non-root mode.
That way you only need to specify the values at runtime and pass
the `-u pulse` if need be. (run `id` in your terminal to see your
own `PUID`/`PGID` values.)

Running `make` starts the service.

```
# make
docker run --rm -it \
  --name docker_pulseaudio --hostname pulseaudio \
  -c 256 -m 256m \
  -e PGID=1000 -e PUID=1000 \
  -p 4713:4713 \
  --net=host \
  --cap-add NET_ADMIN \
  --device /dev/snd \
  --device /dev/bus/usb \
  -v config/pulse:/etc/pulse \ # (optional)
  -v /var/run/dbus:/var/run/dbus \
  -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro \
  woahbase/alpine-pulseaudio:x86_64
```

Running `make shell` gets a shell inside the container, but does
not run the init system, so that it can be done manually.

```
# make shell
docker run --rm -it \
  --name docker_pulseaudio --hostname pulseaudio \
  --entrypoint /bin/bash \
  -c 256 -m 256m \
  -e PGID=1000 -e PUID=1000 \
  -p 4713:4713 \
  --net=host \
  --cap-add NET_ADMIN \
  --device /dev/snd \
  --device /dev/bus/usb \
  -v config/pulse:/etc/pulse \ # (optional)
  -v /var/run/dbus:/var/run/dbus \
  -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro \
  woahbase/alpine-pulseaudio:x86_64
```

Stop the container with a timeout, (defaults to 2 seconds)

```
# make stop
docker stop -t 2 docker_pulseaudio
```

Removes the container, (always better to stop it first and `-f`
only when needed most)

```
# make rm
docker rm -f docker_pulseaudio
```

Restart the container with

```
# make restart
docker restart docker_pulseaudio
```

---
#### Shell access
---

Get a shell inside a already running container,

```
# make debug
docker exec -it docker_pulseaudio /bin/bash
```

set user or login as root,

```
# make rdebug
docker exec -u root -it docker_pulseaudio /bin/bash
```

To check logs of a running container in real time

```
# make logs
docker logs -f docker_pulseaudio
```

---
### Development
---

If you have the repository access, you can clone and
build the image yourself for your own system, and can push after.

---
#### Setup
---

Before you clone the [repo][231], you must have [Git][101], [GNU make][102],
and [Docker][103] setup on the machine.

```
git clone https://github.com/woahbase/alpine-pulseaudio
cd alpine-pulseaudio
```
You can always skip installing **make** but you will have to
type the whole docker commands then instead of using the sweet
make targets.

---
#### Build
---

You need to have binfmt_misc configured in your system to be able
to build images for other architectures.

Otherwise to locally build the image for your system.
[`ARCH` defaults to `x86_64`, need to be explicit when building
for other architectures.]

```
# make ARCH=x86_64 build
# sets up binfmt if not x86_64
docker build --rm --compress --force-rm \
  --no-cache=true --pull \
  -f ./Dockerfile_x86_64 \
  --build-arg DOCKERSRC=woahbase/alpine-s6:x86_64 \
  --build-arg PGID=1000 \
  --build-arg PUID=1000 \
  -t woahbase/alpine-pulseaudio:x86_64 \
  .
```

To check if its working..

```
# make ARCH=x86_64 test
docker run --rm -it \
  --name docker_pulseaudio --hostname pulseaudio \
  -e PGID=1000 -e PUID=1000 \
  --entrypoint sh \
  woahbase/alpine-pulseaudio:x86_64 \
  -ec 'pulseaudio --version'
```

And finally, if you have push access,

```
# make ARCH=x86_64 push
docker push woahbase/alpine-pulseaudio:x86_64
```
